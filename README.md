# COMP3005-Final-Project
Welcome to the Fitness Management System! This is a Python application that utilizes a PostgreSQL database. It is designed to streamline the operations of fitness centers and gyms by automating member management, class scheduling, maintenance tracking, and billing processes.
## Prerequisites:
Python 3.8 or higher  
PostgreSQL  
Pip for Python package installation  

## Setting up database:
Download and unzip the file  
Create a new database and name it at your convenience  
Copy the DDL query code to make up the table  
Copy the DML query code to insert sample data  

## Execution commands:
After setting up PostgreSQL start with our system!  
1. Open it via Pycharm or any other IDE by importing the project.   
2. *Then enter in the command line: pip install psycopg2-binary  
3. Run and executing the "main_menu.py"
4. Enter in the command line:  
   Enter database name: the name must be identical to the database name you have created  
   Enter your username and password for Postgres  
   Choose options in the menu to use the system  


## Execution notes (Please read before using the system):
Training Class Creating and Booking Logic:  
1. Trainers are required to select one or more dates available in the upcoming week, specify the name of the class, and determine preference class type(group/personal). This information is then forwarded to the staff;
2. Staffs on their side choose the exact start time and end time for this session on the trainer's selected available date, also can decide the class type(group/personal);  
3. Members can view and book all the available classes by select "Book a class" in the menu, the availability of classes is as follows:
    
   >If the class type is personal, and has already been booked by another member, it will not be visible in the list of available classes;    
   If the class type is group(with a maximum of 5 members), and is fully booked, it will not be visible in the list of available classes;
   
5. Once a member successfully books a class, that class will no longer appear in their list of available classes until the member cancels the class.
   
Dashboard display menu:  
The member will only get their exercise routines, fitness achievements, and health statistics after they finish taking the classes.

1. Create_database_DDL.sql:  
A SQL script with commands to create the gym management systemâ€™s database structure, including tables and constraints.  
2. Sample_data_DML.sql:  
A script for inserting sample records into the database, allowing for initial functionality testing.  
3. ER Model: ER-diagram(JPG format):  
An image showing the entity-relationship model, which outlines the database entities and their relationships.  
4. Relational Schema: Relational_database_Schema(JPG format)  
A visual schema detailing the tables, columns, and relationships within the database.
